        <p>Overall we utilized shades of blue and cyan to promote tranquility, instilling calmness and emotional stability for users dealing with stress and anxiety. 
            They are commonly known to evoke trust and reliability so that the users can feel a sense of comfort and confidence in seeking support. 
            White is also evident in our palette because of its positive associations with peace, which create a hopeful atmosphere. 
            Each is also tested to ensure contrast and readability is possible with the certain usages and sizes.

                    <p>Lapis Lazuli evokes the feeling of depth and stability, like the depths of the ocean.</p>
                    <p>This will be our <span class="bold">foreground color</span>. All main text such as, the headings, body copy, and button texts will use this color.
                    It will also sometimes be used in reverse as the background color for components that need to contrast the background color. For example, the navigation menu bar, information cards, and variant buttons.
                    In this case, the button text will use the "background color" to oppose.

                    <p>This will be the <span class="bold">accent color</span>. This will be used as our main accent color for dynamic components on the app. 
                        Navigation buttons, separate from the navigation bar, will have this background color applied to show variation in button type and hierarchy.
                        It will also be utilized in overlay pop ups to contrast dark background.

                    <p>This will be the <span class="bold">accent color</span>. This color is minimally used, but effectively to catch the attention through an accent. 
                        For example, progress bars, snack bars, or on tap states of buttons. It will act as a decoration color or for important details that provide feedback for the users.

                        When background is reversed to Lapis Lazuli for certain component cards, this color will serve as the text color.
