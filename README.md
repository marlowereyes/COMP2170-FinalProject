This application is a fun and interactive website that contains minigames, quizzes, jokes, and a bunch of silly activities. This site is meant to provide a comedic relief amidst all the stress, seriousness, and panic of all our other assignments and stressors. The application created consists of four different pages; the home page and one page per person. In each of our own pages, we coded something that brings us joy and expresses ourselves. 

In the Marlowe page, you will find a page of “Random things of the day.” There is a pop up that showcases the answer to the joke of the day, that pops out after every five seconds. Next, there is a quiz of the day that provides a personalized answer based on the different questions that were asked. Last, there are 4 images of eggs that, when clicked on, shoot out an inspirational message.
